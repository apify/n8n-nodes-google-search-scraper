This is an n8n community node that integrates [Apify](https://apify.com) with your n8n workflows, so you can run Apify Actors, extract structured data from websites, and automate complex web scraping tasks.

[Apify](https://apify.com) is a platform for developers to build, deploy, and publish web automation tools, while [n8n](https://n8n.io/) is a [fair-code licensed](https://docs.n8n.io/reference/license/) tool for AI workflow automation that allows you to connect various services.

## Installation

### ⚙️ Prerequisites

- Node.js v23.11.1 or higher

---

### 1. Initialize n8n locally

Initialize n8n locally with the following commands.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Self-hosted n8n: Public webhook URL for triggers

This configuration is required for our service's trigger functionality to work correctly.

When running n8n locally, webhook URLs use `localhost` by default, which external services cannot reach. To enable trigger functionality, set a publicly accessible webhook URL:

	```bash
	export WEBHOOK_URL="https://your-tunnel.local"
	```
and restart your local n8n instance:

  ```bash
  npm run dev

## Operations

![operations](./docs/actions.png)

This node supports a wide range of Apify operations, organized by resource type:

### Actors
- **Run Actor**: Execute an Actor with optional input parameters
  - **Default behavior**: Uses predefined input values
  - **Custom input**: Provide JSON object to override any or all default parameters.
  - Configurable timeout and memory limits
  - Build version selection
- **Scrape Single URL**: Quick scraping of a single URL
- **Get Last Run**: Retrieve information about the most recent Actor run

![actor run](./docs/run-actor.png)

### Actor tasks
- **Run Task**: Execute a predefined Actor task
  - Supports custom input JSON
  - Configurable timeout
  - Task-specific settings

### Actor runs
- **Get User Runs List**: List all runs for a user
  - Pagination support
  - Sorting options
  - Status filtering
- **Get run**: Retrieve detailed information about a specific run

### Datasets
- **Get Items**: Fetch items from a dataset

### Key-Value Stores
- **Get Key-Value Store Record**: Retrieve a specific record by key

### Triggers
  Automatically start an n8n workflow whenever an Actor or task finishes execution
  - Can be configured to trigger on success, failure, abort, timeout or any combination of these states
  - Includes run metadata in the output
  - Available triggers: 
    - **Actor Run Finished**: Start a workflow when an Actor run completes
    - **Task Run Finished**: Start a workflow when a task run completes

![triggers](./docs/trigger.png)

## Credentials

The node supports two authentication methods:

1. **API key authentication**
   - Configure your Apify API key in the n8n credentials section under `apifyApi`

2. **OAuth2 authentication** (available only in n8n cloud)
   - Configure OAuth2 credentials in the n8n credentials section under `apifyOAuth2Api`

![auth](./docs/auth.png)


## Compatibility

This node has been tested with n8n version 1.57.0.

## Usage

1. Create an Actor: Set up a new Actor on [Apify](https://apify.com).
2. Set up a workflow: Create a new workflow in n8n.
3. Add the Apify node: Insert the Apify node into your workflow.
4. Configure credentials: Enter your Apify API key and Actor ID.
5. Select an operation: Choose the desired operation for the node.
6. Execute the workflow: Run the workflow to execute the Apify operation.

# Releasing a New Version

This project uses a GitHub Actions workflow to automate the release process, including publishing to npm. Here's how to trigger a new release.

Prerequisites (for all methods):

## Method 1: Using the GitHub Web UI (Recommended for ease of use)

1.  Navigate to GitHub Releases:
    * Go to your repository’s**Releases** tab
2.  Draft a New Release:
    * Select the **Draft a new release** button.
3.  Create or Choose a Tag:
    * In the **Choose a tag** dropdown:
        * Type your new tag name (e.g., `v1.2.3`).
        * If the tag doesn't exist, GitHub prompts you to create it.
        * Ensure the **target branch** selected for creating the new tag is correct. This tag will point to the latest commit on this target branch.
4.  Set Release Title and Notes:
    * Set the "Release title" (e.g., `vX.Y.Z` or a more descriptive title).
    * For the release notes in the description field, you have a few options:
        * Write your prepared release notes.
        * Select the **Generate release notes** button: GitHub will attempt to automatically create release notes based on merged pull requests since the last release. You can then review and edit these auto-generated notes.
5.  Publish the Release:
    * Select the **Publish release** button.


## Method 2: Fully CLI-Driven Release

This method uses the GitHub CLI (`gh`) for all steps, including tag creation.

1.  Ensure your local target branch is synced and changes are pushed:
    ```bash
    git checkout master
    git pull origin master
    ```
2.  Create the Release (which also creates and pushes the tag):
    Replace `vX.Y.Z` with your desired tag/version. The command will create this tag from the latest commit of your specified `--target` branch (defaults to repository's default branch, if `--target` is omitted and the branch is up to date).
    ```bash
    gh release create vX.Y.Z \
        --target master \
        --title "vX.Y.Z" \
        --notes "Your detailed release notes here.
        - Feature X
        - Bugfix Y"
    # Or, to use notes from a file:
    gh release create vX.Y.Z \
        --target master \
        --title "vX.Y.Z" \
        --notes-file ./RELEASE_NOTES.md
    # Or, to generate notes from pull requests (commits must follow conventional commit format for best results):
    gh release create vX.Y.Z \ 
        --target master \
        --title "vX.Y.Z" 
        --generate-notes
    ```
    
    * `vX.Y.Z`: The tag and release name.
    * `--target <branch>`: Specifies which branch the tag should be created from (e.g., `master`). If the tag `vX.Y.Z` doesn't exist, `gh` will create it based on the HEAD of this target branch and push it.
    * `--title "<title>"`: The title for your release.
    * `--notes "<notes>"` or `--notes-file <filepath>` or `--generate-notes`: Your release notes.
    *This command will create the tag, push it to GitHub, and then publish the release. This "published" release event triggers the automated workflow.*

---

## Post-Release: Automated Workflow & Verification (Common to all methods)

Regardless of how you create and publish the GitHub Release:

1.  Automated Workflow Execution:
    * The "Release & Publish" GitHub Actions workflow will automatically trigger.
    * It will perform:
        1.  Code checkout.
        2.  Version extraction (`X.Y.Z`) from the release tag.
        3.  Build and test processes.
        4.  Update `package.json` and `package-lock.json` to version `X.Y.Z`.
        5.  Commit these version changes back to the branch the release was targeted from with a message like `chore(release): set version to X.Y.Z [skip ci]`.
        6.  Publish the package `@apify/n8n-nodes-apify-actor-template@X.Y.Z` to npm.

2.  Verify the Package on npm:
    After the workflow successfully completes (check the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository):
    * Verify the new version on npm:
        ```bash
        npm view @apify/n8n-nodes-apify-actor-template version
        ```
        This should print `X.Y.Z`.

## Troubleshooting

### Common issues

1. Authentication errors
   - Verify your API key is correct

2. Resource Not Found
   - Verify the resource ID format
   - Check if the resource exists in your Apify account
   - Ensure you have access to the resource

3. Operation failures
   - Check the input parameters
   - Verify resource limits (memory, timeout)
   - Review Apify Console for detailed error messages

### Getting help
